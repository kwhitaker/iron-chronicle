# Iron Chronicle

A player aid for the [Ironsworn RPG](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/).  Right now running this locally will create a character sheet with some very basic rolling functionality.  This project is mostly a way for me to explore some javascript packages.  I've gotten bored with it, so I may (probably) never finish it.  There is currently no persistence, but that could be easily added with some local storage or IndexDB functionality.

If you _do_ decide to fork it, I would appreciate some credit.

## To Run:
```bash
$ yarn # or npm install
$ yarn start # or npm start
```

## For tests
```bash
$ yarn test # watch mode
$ yarn rite # test once
```

## For linting
```bash
$ yarn lint
```
